# NeatLayout
UIView extension for simple constraint-adding syntax.

Provides methods for adding constraints in code with easy syntax similar to one of PureLayout.

Available constraints are designed for:

- view centering
- pinning edges to other views' edges
- aligning axes
- setting view's width, height or size

Also includes tests for all methods.

-----------------------------------------------------

All you need to start using NeatLayout in your project, just add NeatLayout.swift file (to "Extensions" folder in your project, if you're a tidy person).
